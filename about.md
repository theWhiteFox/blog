blog.theWhiteFox :rocket:
I am using GitHub to host this blog with a cname from my [blacknight](https://www.blacknight.com/) account.
[This blog code on GitHub for `blog.theWhiteFox.ninja`](https://github.com/theWhiteFox/blog) 
I am using [jekll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for many good reasons some are it's static works real good with GitHub Pages easy to set up and get running locally.

[blog.theWhiteFox.ninja](http://blog.theWhiteFox.ninja) is a static site hosted on [GitHub pages](http://pages.github.com/).

## Running the site locally

 - [Install Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/installation/)
 - [Install Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
 - First, cd into the folder where your Jekyll website is stored.
 - Then, jekyll serve --watch. (Jekyll explains more build options.)
 - View your website at http://127.0.0.1:4000.
 - When youâ€™re done, commit the changes and push everything to the master branch of your GitHub user website. GitHub Pages will then rebuild and serve the website.
