I love to cook / eat delicious food (especially sauces) I love to read and learn new recipes. Algorithms for me are like recipes in programming. So as my cooking skills have improved by learning recipes, I hope my programming skills will improve by learning algorithms. I choose JS as the language to learn these algorithms / recipes because it's the language of the web and a language I want to master.

I want to improve my problem solving JS writing skills, these are some JS algorithms that I am going to learn to write not to memorize. 

I am using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), [gists theWhiteFox/](https://gist.github.com/theWhiteFox/) and [repl.it](https://repl.it) to write, debug, display and output the code.

Algorithms
- Fibonacci
- FizzBuzz
- Dijkstra
