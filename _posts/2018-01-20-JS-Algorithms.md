I love to cook (especially sauces) and eat delicious food. I love to read and learn new recipes. Algorithms for me are like recipes in programming. So as my cooking skills have improved by learning recipes, I hope my programming skills will improve by learning algorithms. I chose JS as the language to learn these algorithms / recipes because it's the language of the web and a language I want to master.

I also want to improve my problem solving / JS writing skills, these are some [JS algorithms](http://thewhitefox.github.io/Algorithms-JS/) that I am going to learn to write not to memorize. 

I am using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), [gists theWhiteFox](https://gist.github.com/theWhiteFox/) and [repl.it](https://repl.it) to write, debug, display and output the code.

Algorithms
- Fibonacci
- FizzBuzz
- Dijkstra
